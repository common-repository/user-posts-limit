[Documentation](https://en.condless.com/user-posts-limit/) | [Contact](https://en.condless.com/contact/)

= How To Use =
1. Plugin Settings: Select role, post type, limit, and cycle.

= How It Works =
* On post creation the number of posts from this post type belong to this user for the specified cycle will be counted and if applicable the post creation will be prevented.

= Features =
* **Post Creation Limits**: Limit the number of posts each user role can create daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/ever.
* **Hide Content**: In order to make some content hidden when posts limit exceeded wrap it with the shortcodes (replace &#34;post&#34; with the post type of the relevant rules): [upl_hide type=&#34;post&#34;][/upl_hide]
* **Display Limits**: Display the limits to the user anywhere with the [upl_limits] shortcode.
* **Users Stats**: Track how many posts each user used from his quota.
* **Multisite**: Network-wide rules can be applied via the Network Admin Dashboard (doesn't support the Hide Content, Display Limits and Users Stats features).
* **Integrations**: WooCommerce, Paid Memberships Pro, MyListing theme, Restrict Content Pro, PeepSo, WordPress REST API.
* **Limits per User**: Set limits per user (see instructions in docs).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the limits do not work as expected? =

* The counts include posts in trash/draft/pending status
* Limits will not be applied on users with the Plugin Management Capability or (in multisite) the create_users capability
* The post creation date and not the post published date is taken into account when using the cycle option

= How to use the [upl_hide] shortcode with Elementor? =

Insert shortcode widget with [upl_hide type=&#34;post&#34;][/upl_start] before your content and another shortcode widget with [/upl_hide] after your content.
